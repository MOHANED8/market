Grocery Store Program
This program is designed to simulate a simple grocery store where a customer can buy different products by either weight or quantity. The program calculates the total cost of the purchase and applies a discount based on the quantity bought. The program is written in C language.

How the Program Works:
1.The program consists of several functions that work together to provide the required functionality.

2.The main function runs in a loop until the customer decides to stop buying. Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to enter the product number and the type of amount they want to buy (quantity or weight). Based on the user's input, the program calculates the total cost of the purchase and applies a discount based on the quantity bought. The program then adds the total cost to the payment variable.

3.The "find_part" function is used to find the index of the product in the array based on the product number entered by the user.

4.The "totalPrice" function is used to calculate the total cost of the purchase based on the quantity or weight of the product and the unit or kilo price of the product.

5.The "discount" function is used to calculate the discount based on the quantity bought and applies it to the total cost of the purchase.

Input Validation:

The program validates the user's input to ensure that it is within the acceptable range. For example, if the user enters an invalid product number, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid product number. Similarly, if the user enters a negative quantity or weight, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid quantity or weight.

Conclusion:

This program demonstrates the basic principles of programming, including functions, loops, and input validation. It provides a simple simulation of a grocery store and can be used as a starting point for more complex programs.
